    "description": "Facial Cleansers are designed to remove dirt, oil, pollution, daily sunscreen and makeup, but it’s important to choose a formula that addresses the needs of specific skin types without disrupting the skin’s natural barrier. Those with dry skin can enjoy the benefits of both a cream cleanser that hydrates and a foaming formula that provides a refreshing skin feel—without having to choose between the two. Developed with dermatologists, CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser begins as a cream before transforming to a rich soft foam when you begin to lather it on the skin with water. CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam effectively removes dirt,oil,daily suncreen and even long-wear facial makeup without stripping the skin’s natural moisture or leaving it feeling tight and dry. This gentle, fragrance-free formula features three essential Ceramides, amino acids and Hyaluronic Acid, which work together to help maintain the skin barrier and lock in moisture.",
